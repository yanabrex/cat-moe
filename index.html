                <h2>About Moe</h2>
                <p>Meet this beautiful 2 year old tabby. Moe has been my beloved 
                pet and a proud family member since late 2023. He traveled here 
                all the way from Texas.

                <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
                <p>Moe has a distinct M on his forehead which all tabby cats 
                normally have. Tabby fur pattern is pretty popular and you can 
                quickly spot one by their well pronounced stripes or spots. Many 
                tabbies are known to be very playful, loving, and intelligent.

                <h2>Some Quirks</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike many cats I have met so far, Moe is <strong>very</strong> 
                    skittish. He gets scared so easily that when somebody comes down 
                    the staircase this cat starts running! If someone would sneeze, 
                    move their foot, chair, anything. Moe is quite a funny cat!
